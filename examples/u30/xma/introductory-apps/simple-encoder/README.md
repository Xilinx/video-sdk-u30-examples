# simple-encoder
This folder contains the bare minimum number of items required to demonstrate an encode operation, using U30. These items are:

1. **main.cpp**: Contains sample XMA-based C code
2. **test/pipe.sh**: Shows a simple encode example using CPU stdin and stdout pipes
3. **build.sh** & **CMakeLists.txt**: Together they perform the build process
