# This script accepts an 8-bit, YUV420, 1080p60 RAW file and will send it to the scaler, which outputs various renditions of various sizes,
# and sends them to the encoder targeting various bitrates (as defined by the -b:v flag). All outputs will be stored at /tmp/

# You may edit this to accept other sizes (-s), other framerates (-r), other output bitrates (-b:v).

# The 1080p60 input is scaled down to the following resolutions, framerates, and bitrates (respectively):
# 720p60 4.0   Mbps
# 720p30 3.0   Mbps
# 480p30 2.5   Mbps
# 360p30 1.25  Mbps
# 160p30 0.625 Mbps

# You may edit this to enable other output bitrates (-b:v).
# You may also save the output file by replacing /dev/null with an output path.
# You may change the output framerate via the (-r) flags

# You may change the target codecs to HEVC by changing:
#     (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for encoding into HEVC
