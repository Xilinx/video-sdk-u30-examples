# This script expects 3 H.264 files and will transcode them to HEVC, sending the outputs to /tmp/xil_xcode_{n}.mp4.
# The three transcodes are run in parallel in individual xterms. 
# The first job is run on device #0 and the two others jobs are run on device #1.
# After the jobs are launched, a JSON system load report is generated.

# You may edit this script to run the job on a different combination of devices (-xlnx_hwdev).
# You may skip saving the resulting videos by setting /dev/null as the output (-y).
