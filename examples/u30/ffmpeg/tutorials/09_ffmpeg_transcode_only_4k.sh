# The U30 Video SDK solution supports real-time decoding and encoding of 4k streams with the following notes:
# - The U30 video pipeline is optimized for live-streaming use cases. For 4k streams with bitrates significantly higher than the ones typically used for live streaming, it may not be possible to sustain real-time performance.
# - When decoding 4k streams with a high bitrate, increasing the number of entropy buffers using the -entropy_buffers_count option can help improve performance
# - When encoding raw video to 4k, set the -s option to 3840x2160 to specify the desired resolution.
# - When encoding 4k streams to H.264, the -slices option is required to sustain real-time performance. A value of 4 is recommended. This option is not required when encoding to HEVC.
# - The lookahead feature is not supported for 4k. FFmpeg will give an error if -lookahead_depth is enabled when encoding to 4k.

# This script accepts an 8-bit, pre-encoded HEVC file and will send the encoded H.264 output to /tmp/xil_4k_xcode.mp4 at a rate of 20Mbps.

# You may edit this to enable other output bitrates (-b:v).

# You may change the target codecs by changing:
#     the input codec from  (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) for decoding from H264
#     the output codec from (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for encoding to HEVC
