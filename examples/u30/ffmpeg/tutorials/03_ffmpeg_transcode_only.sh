# This script accepts an 8-bit, YUV420, pre-encoded h264 file and will send the encoded h.264 output to /tmp/xil_xcode.mp4 at a rate of 8Mbps.

# You may edit this to enable other output bitrates (-b:v).
# You may also save the output file by replacing /dev/null with an output path.

# You may change the target codecs to HEVC by changing:
#     the first  instance of (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for decoding from HEVC
#     the second instance of (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for encoding into HEVC
