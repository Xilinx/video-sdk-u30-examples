# This script takes two arguments: 
#  - The full path to a pre-encoded 4K60 YUV420 HEVC file
#  - The ID of a job slot separately allocated using the job slot reservation tool and the '14_ffmpeg_transcode_2dev_4k.json' file associated to this example

# The script uses two devices to transcode the input stream to 4K H264 and 1080p HEVC.
# The first device is used to decode the 4K60 input, scale it to 1080p60 and encode the 4K H264 output.
# The second device is used to encode the 1080p60 HEVC output.
# Both outputs are sent to /dev/null
