#This script accepts an 8-bit, YUV420, 1080p60 RAW file and will send the encoded h.264 output to /tmp/xil_enc_out.mp4 at a rate of 8Mbps.

#You may edit this to accept other sizes (-s), other framerates (-r), other output bitrates (-b:v).
#You may also save the output file by replacing /dev/null with an output path.

# You may change the target codecs to HEVC by changing:
#     (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for encoding into HEVC
