# This script accepts an 10-bit, YUV420, pre-encoded h264 file and will crop a 300x200 sized section of the original video. The section's top left corner begins at 20 pixels to the right, and 10 pixels down from the top-left corner of the original video. The output video is encoded in 8Mbps, and is saved to /tmp/xil_crop_zoom.mp4
