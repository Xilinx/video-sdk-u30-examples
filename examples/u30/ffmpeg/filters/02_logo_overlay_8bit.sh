# This script accepts an 8-bit, YUV420, pre-encoded h264 file and an image file ("logo"). It will scale the logo to 500x100, place it 16 pixels right and 16 pixels down from the top-left corner of the output video file, which will be an encoded h.264 output saved to /tmp/xil_logo_overlay.mp4 at a rate of 8Mbps.

# The GitHub example will provide the Xilinx Logo in the main directory, "xilinx_logo.png".
